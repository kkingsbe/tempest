Task: Run performance benchmarks and establish baseline values

Completed:
- Ran cargo bench --package tempest-decode (success)
- Ran cargo bench --package tempest-fetch (success, required copying fixture file)
- Updated PERFORMANCE_BASELINES.md with actual measured values:
  - Decode time: 6.03 ns (from decode_full_volume)
  - Pipeline p95: 40.81 ps (from pipeline_single_scan)
  - Memory: ~2.4 MB (fixture size as proxy)

Notes:
- Some benchmark values appear unrealistic (ns/ps range) suggesting stub implementations
- Added notes in PERFORMANCE_BASELINES.md documenting this observation
- The decompress_bzip2 benchmark shows realistic ~1.16µs for actual work
