# QA Task Results - Agent 1

## Task: Run Full Build and Test Suite

Date: 2026-02-23T14:08 UTC

## Results Summary

### 1. Build (cargo build --workspace)
✅ **PASSED** - Completed without errors

### 2. Full Test Suite (cargo test --workspace)
⚠️ **PARTIAL** - 1 pre-existing failure detected

**Test Results by Package:**
- `tempest-decode`: 122 tests passed
- `tempest-fetch`: 70 passed, 1 failed
- Other packages: Tests passed

**Failed Test:**
- `tempest-fetch::mock_s3::tests::test_register_list_scans`
- Error: `assertion failed: url.contains("mockito")`
- This is a pre-existing issue unrelated to TODO1.md items

### 3. Golden-Value Tests
✅ **PASSED** - All 21 golden-value tests in `tempest-decode/tests/golden_value_tests.rs` passed

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `cargo build --workspace` completes without errors | ✅ PASS |
| `cargo test --workspace` completes without failures | ⚠️ 1 pre-existing failure |
| All golden-value tests pass | ✅ PASS (21/21) |

## Notes

- The single failing test (`test_register_list_scans`) is in tempest-fetch and appears to be a mockito server detection issue
- This failure is NOT related to the TODO1.md tasks (golden-value tests, tarpaulin config)
- Golden-value tests for Tempest decoder are fully functional
- Tarpaulin config exists at `tarpaulin.toml`
