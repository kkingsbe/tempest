Agent 4 - Sprint 1 Complete
===========================

Date: 2026-02-22

## Tasks Completed

1. **Write unit tests for decoder** ✓
   - Defined core types: VolumeScan, Sweep, Radial, Gate, Moment, DecodeError
   - Created 17 TDD tests for radial data extraction (tests fail as expected - implementation pending)
   - 19 existing unit tests passing

2. **Initial CI setup** ✓
   - Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Tier 1 CI: fmt check, clippy lint, unit tests, release build
   - Triggers on push to main and pull requests

## Build Status
- cargo fmt: ✓
- cargo clippy: ✓
- cargo test: ✓ (19 pass, 17 fail expected - TDD RED phase)
- cargo build --release: ✓

## Notes
- Tests for radial data extraction are intentionally failing (TDD RED phase)
- Decoder implementation will be done by Agent 2
- Tests will pass once Agent 2 implements the radial parsing
