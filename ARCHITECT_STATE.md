## Session Notes
- This is a continuation session - sprint still in progress
- No new inbox items to process
- .sprint_complete does NOT exist - cannot start new sprint
- Per protocol: "If any agent's TODO<N>.md still has unchecked items and no .agent_done_<N>, they're still working — leave them alone"
