## Completed This Session

- [x] Task 1: Skills Inventory - Analyzed all 6 skill files in ./skills directory
- [x] Task 2: Gap Analysis - Verified PRD requirements are covered in BACKLOG.md
- [x] Task 3: Design Debt Review - DESIGN_DEBT.md does not exist (skipped)
- [x] Task 4: Sprint Management - Verified Sprint 5 is ACTIVE with all 4 agents working
- [x] Task 5: Blocker Review - All blockers in BLOCKERS.md are resolved

## Currently Working On

- [ ] Sprint 5 completion monitoring
  - Context: All 4 agents have active TODO items. No .agent_done_* files exist yet.

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Wait for Sprint 5 to complete (all agents finish their tasks)
- [ ] Once complete, verify .sprint_complete is created
- [ ] Start Sprint 6 planning after current sprint finishes

## Agent Status

| Agent | Queue Status | Tasks Remaining | Blocked? |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------- | -------- |
| 1     | WORKING      | 3 color tables  | No       |
| 2     | WORKING      | 4 S3 tasks     | No       |
| 3     | WORKING      | 3 cache/poll   | No       |
| 4     | WORKING      | 3 wgpu tasks   | No       |

## Skills Inventory Summary

| Skill | Purpose | Task Types |
|-------|---------|------------|
| DISCLI.md | Discord notifications | Progress updates |
| coding-guidelines | Rust naming/formatting | All Rust code |
| frontend-design | UI components | Any web/UI work |
| rust-best-practices | Idiomatic Rust | All Rust development |
| rust-engineer | Systems/async | Core implementation |
| test-driven-development | TDD methodology | All features/bugfixes |

## Key Findings

1. **Sprint 5 is ACTIVE** - Cannot start new sprint until current completes
2. **No .sprint_complete exists** - Sprint still in progress
3. **No .agent_done_* files** - Agents still working
4. **DESIGN_DEBT.md doesn't exist** - No design debt tracking
5. **BLOCKERS.md shows all resolved** - No active blockers

## Next Steps

The architect session should:
1. Wait for agents to complete Sprint 5
2. Once .sprint_complete is created, plan Sprint 6
3. Before planning Sprint 6, re-run architect to pull from BACKLOG.md
