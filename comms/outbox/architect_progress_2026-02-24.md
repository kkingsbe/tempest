# Architect Progress Report - 2026-02-24

## Date/Time of Update
2026-02-24T16:05:00Z

## Sprint Number and Status
**Sprint 21** - INCOMPLETE

| Agent | Status | Done File |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Agent 1 | ✅ DONE | .agent_done_1 exists |
| Agent 2 | ✅ DONE | .agent_done_2 exists |
| Agent 3 | ⏳ IN PROGRESS | Working on DD-035, DD-034 |
| Agent 4 | ✅ DONE | .agent_done_4 exists |

**Gate Issue:** `.sprint_complete` file exists but was created prematurely (Sprint 20 content). Agent 3 has not completed their work - TODO3.md still has incomplete tasks.

## Tasks Completed in This Architect Session

1. **PRD Review Completed**
   - Reviewed PRD.md for ambiguous/impossible items
   - Existing architect_questions.md already documents 5 PRD ambiguities:
     - PRD-1: Super-resolution performance targets
     - PRD-2: E2E test harness selection (Playwright vs native)
     - PRD-3: Prefetch budget default value
     - PRD-4: Golden image coverage scope
     - PRD-5: Range-folding corrections implementation

2. **DISCLI Skill Reviewed**
   - Reviewed skills/DISCLI.md for Discord notification capability
   - Confirmed command syntax: `discli send "message"`

## Agent Work Queues Status

| Agent | Current Focus | TODO File |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Agent 1 | Coverage Ratchet, Performance Benchmarks | TODO1.md |
| Agent 2 | CI Pipeline, Visual Regression Tests | TODO2.md |
| Agent 3 | Cache Module Design Debt (DD-035, DD-034) | TODO3.md |
| Agent 4 | QA verification | TODO4.md |

## Design Debt Status

**6 OPEN items:**
- DD-031 (HIGH, S): timeline.rs TIMELINE_HEIGHT = 56.0 (should be 48 or 64)
- DD-024 (HIGH, S): timeline.rs TOTAL_HEIGHT calculation due to DD-031
- DD-035 (MEDIUM, S): cache.rs expect() in production code
- DD-034 (MEDIUM, S): cache.rs cloning key.to_string() twice
- DD-033 (MEDIUM, S): types.rs using String instead of &str
- DD-032 (MEDIUM, S): types.rs incorrect naming as_str_lossy()

## Blockers

**Pre-existing Build Failures (tempest-app):**
- 62 compilation errors due to iced 0.13.x API compatibility issues
- Error categories: theme module, style variables, text styling, padding format, align_items deprecation
- Status: UNRESOLVED - separate from Agent 3's work

## Gap Analysis Summary

- PRD Phase 8 (Release/Testing): ~40% complete
- Missing: E2E Test Harness, Golden Reference Images CLI, Coverage Ratchet Policy, Performance Benchmarks
- Skills identified: test-driven-development, iced-rs, rust-best-practices

## Next Steps

1. Agent 3 must complete TODO3.md tasks (DD-035 expect(), DD-034 cloning)
2. Once all agents done, clear .sprint_complete and start Sprint 22
3. Include design debt DD-031/DD-024 in next sprint (High priority)
4. Address iced API compatibility blocker before UI work can proceed
5. Architect to send Discord progress notification using DISCLI
