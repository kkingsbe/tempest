**Sprint Status:** Sprint 22 IN PROGRESS

**Agent Status:**
- Agent 1: 🔄 WORKING (Coverage Ratchet, Performance Benchmarks)
- Agent 2: ✅ DONE (premature .agent_done_2 created, TODO shows unchecked)
- Agent 3: ✅ DONE (DD-035, DD-034 resolved)
- Agent 4: ✅ DONE (DD-033, DD-032, DD-036, PRD verification)

**Sprint Gate:** CLOSED (.sprint_complete does NOT exist)

**Design Debt (4 open):**
- DD-037, DD-038, DD-039 (Medium) - StationSelector/MomentSwitcher
- DD-040 likely exists

**Blockers:** None - pre-existing build failures resolved

**Next Steps:**
- Agent 1 needs to complete remaining work
- When all agents done, .sprint_complete will be created
- Sprint 23 will address remaining design debt
