### Completed Tasks:
1. **Build Health Check** - BUILD PASSED, TESTS FAILED - [BUILDFIX] injected to Agent 4
2. **Skills Inventory** - Listed and analyzed available skills
3. **Gap Analysis & Sprint Planning** - Assessed current state vs. targets
4. **Work Rebalancing Check** - No action needed (BUILDFIX is the blocker)
5. **Design Debt Review** - 15 open items reviewed, 3 High priority items noted for next sprint
6. **Sprint Management** - Sprint ACTIVE, no new sprint needed
7. **Blocker Review** - No active blockers

### Current Blocker:
- **test_utils.rs compilation errors** - 5 compile errors preventing tests from passing
- **Assigned to:** Agent 4 (BUILDFIX task)

### Recommendations:
1. Prioritize resolving BUILDFIX to unblock Agent 1 and Agent 2
2. Schedule design debt items for next sprint (3 High priority items)
3. Continue parallel development - Agents 1, 2, and 4 are making progress
