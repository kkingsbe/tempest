## Key Discoveries in Sprint 8

### Agent 1 Findings
- Color tables for radar moments (REF, VEL, SW, ZDR, CC, KDP) were already fully implemented in `tempest-render-core/src/lib.rs`
- View transform (pan/zoom/rotation) was already fully implemented in `tempest-render/src/view_transform.rs`
- Both features were marked as tasks but were already completed from previous sprints

### Agent 2 Findings
- Station discovery and S3 integration were already completed with 159 tests passing
- `.agent_done_2` file existed from previous session

### Agent 3 Findings
- All three tasks (polling, cache, retry) in TODO3.md were already fully implemented
- Comprehensive test coverage with 45 tests in tempest-fetch
- Full workspace build succeeds with 146+ tests passing

### Sprint 8 Outcome
- All agents (1, 2, 3, 4) finished successfully
- `.sprint_complete` marker created
- Sprint 9 initiated with new focus areas

## Sprint 9 Focus Areas

1. **Agent 1 - Timeline & Playback UI Components**
   - Timeline Bar UI (scan tick marks, click to jump, drag scrub)
   - Playback Controls (play/pause, speed controls, loop mode)
   - Time Range Selection (presets 1h/6h/24h, custom date picker)

2. **Agent 2 - Phase 6 UI Completion**
   - Elevation Tilt Selector (dropdown/slider for sweep selection)
   - Color Legend Display (value-to-color mapping visualization)

3. **Agent 3 - Intelligent Prefetching**
   - Preload next 3-5 radar scans during playback
   - Predictive fetching based on playback direction and speed
   - Integration with existing cache in tempest-fetch

4. **Agent 4 - Phase 8 Offline Mode & Polish**
   - Cache Management UI (size display, manual clear, configurable limit)
   - Offline Mode Detection (auto-detect connectivity, browse cached data)
   - Application Polish (keyboard shortcuts, window title, config file support)

The codebase has reached significant maturity with core rendering, fetching, and caching functionality already in place. Sprint 9 focuses on user-facing features and polish.
