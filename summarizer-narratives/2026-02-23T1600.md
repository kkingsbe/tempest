## Narrative

This hour saw continued progress on multiple fronts, with an architect mode session in progress and significant infrastructure improvements to the testing and build systems.

### Architect Mode Session in Progress

The presence of the new `.architect_in_progress` marker file indicates that an architect mode session was underway during this period. The commit message "chore(architect): session partial - will continue" confirms this was an active architecture planning session that was interrupted mid-way. The `ARCHITECT_STATE.md` file received 46 lines of additions, suggesting substantive updates to the architectural documentation were being made. This session appears to be tracking longer-term architectural decisions for the project, with work continuing from the previous hour's session.

### Visual Regression Testing Infrastructure

A notable addition to the project is the new visual regression testing infrastructure in the `tempest-render` crate. Seven golden image PNG files were added to `tempest-render/tests/golden/`:

- `continental_view.png`
- `local_view.png`
- `reflectivity_0_percent_opacity.png`
- `reflectivity_sweep.png`
- `regional_view.png`
- `spectrum_width_sweep.png`
- `velocity_sweep.png`

These golden images serve as reference baselines for visual regression tests, allowing the team to detect unintended visual changes to radar renderings. The `visual_utils.rs` file in `tempest-render-core/tests/` saw 10 lines removed, likely as part of refactoring related to this new infrastructure. This investment in visual testing helps ensure the renderer produces consistent, expected visual output across code changes.

### Cargo Cleanup

Significant Cargo cleanup occurred during this period. The root `Cargo.lock` underwent substantial cleanup, likely removing unused dependencies and resolving version conflicts. The various `Cargo.toml` files received modest updates: `Cargo.toml` (+7), `tempest-fetch/Cargo.toml` (+6), and `tempest-render/Cargo.toml` (+3). This indicates dependency version bumps and additions necessary for the new visual regression testing infrastructure.

### Tempest-fetch Refactoring

The `tempest-fetch` crate saw several files modified with deletions: `mock_s3.rs` (-82 lines), `fetch_pipeline_test.rs` (-160 lines), `lib.rs` (-4 lines), and `s3.rs` (-2 lines). This represents cleanup and simplification of the fetch pipeline, removing unnecessary code and potentially streamlining the mocking infrastructure.

### CI/CD Improvements

The GitHub Actions workflow file `.github/workflows/ci.yml` had 87 lines changed, indicating significant improvements to the continuous integration pipeline. This likely includes updates to test execution, build processes, or deployment configurations.

### Documentation Updates

Documentation files saw updates as well: `LEARNINGS.md` gained 14 lines, while both `TODO1.md` and `TODO4.md` lost 6 lines each, suggesting items were completed or removed from these todo lists.

---

**Summary**: This hour focused on continuing the architect mode session with substantial progress on visual regression testing infrastructure, Cargo cleanup, and CI/CD improvements. The session was marked as partial and will continue, indicating ongoing architectural planning work.
