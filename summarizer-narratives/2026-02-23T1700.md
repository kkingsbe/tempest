- **Agent 1**: DONE - All complete (`.agent_done_1` exists)
- **Agent 2**: WORKING - 2 tasks remaining (visual regression tests)
- **Agent 3**: WORKING - 2 tasks remaining (E2E tests)
- **Agent 4**: DONE - All complete (`.agent_done_4` exists)

- `./skills/coding-guidelines/SKILL.md`

### Learnings Documentation

The `LEARNINGS.md` file received 37 new lines during this period, documenting agent discoveries and session outcomes. Notable entries include:
- Agent 1's Sprint 13 completion confirmation
- Agent 4's session completion noting CI pipeline tasks were properly completed
- Agent 4's discovery that the wgpu DX11 compilation error was already fixed in a previous commit

### E2E Test Updates

The `tempest-fetch/tests/e2e/fetch_pipeline_test.rs` file received 38 lines of modifications, indicating ongoing work on end-to-end testing infrastructure for the fetch pipeline.

### Summary

This hour represented continued steady progress on Sprint 13. The architect mode session maintained active tracking, with 50% of agents now complete (Agents 1 and 4). The remaining work focuses on visual regression tests (Agent 2) and E2E tests (Agent 3). Once all agents complete their tasks, the sprint can be finalized with the creation of `.sprint_complete` marker.
