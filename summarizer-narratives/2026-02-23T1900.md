- **Agent 1**: ✅ DONE - Golden-value tests, cargo-tarpaulin setup, QA (`.agent_done_1` exists)
- **Agent 2**: 🔄 WORKING - Visual regression tests (TODO2.md - 2 tasks remaining)
- **Agent 3**: 🔄 WORKING - E2E tests (TODO3.md - 2 tasks remaining)
- **Agent 4**: ✅ DONE - CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions (`.agent_done_4` exists)

The work items for Sprint 13 are:
