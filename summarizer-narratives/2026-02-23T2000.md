## Narrative

This hour saw significant progress in design review and technical debt identification, alongside continued work on Sprint 13.

### Design Review Sessions

Two design review sessions were completed during this period:

1. **First Session** (commit 9fd4832): Initial review of tempest-app UI components
2. **Second Session** (commit 7a1d07c): Session completion

The design review identified **7 new design debt items** (DD-001 through DD-007):

| ID | Component | Issue | Priority |
|----|-----------|-------|----------|
| DD-001 | main.rs | Deprecated Sandbox API | High |
| DD-002 | timeline.rs | Arbitrary Spacing Values | High |
| DD-003 | station_selector.rs | (spacing violation) | High |
| DD-004 | color_legend.rs | Design debt item | - |
| DD-005 | color_legend.rs | Design debt item | - |
| DD-006 | elevation_tilt_selector.rs | Design debt item | - |
| DD-007 | elevation_tilt_selector.rs | Design debt item | - |

Components reviewed:
- App (main.rs) - 2 reviews
- TimelineState - 2 reviews  
- StationSelector - 2 reviews
- ColorLegend - 1 review
- ElevationTiltSelector - 1 review
- MomentSwitcher - 1 review (debt found but skipped)
- OfflineIndicator - 1 review (debt found but skipped)
- CacheManager - 0 reviews (never reviewed)

### New Skills and Prompts

Added a new skill for the iced-rs UI framework (`skills/iced-rs/SKILL.md` - 1372 lines), which was used to identify the design debt violations. Also added a new DESIGN_REVIEW.md prompt for future design review sessions.

### Sprint 13 Status

Sprint 13 remains in progress with 2 of 4 agents complete:

- **Agent 1**: ✅ DONE - Golden-value tests (`.agent_done_1` exists)
- **Agent 2**: 🔄 WORKING - Visual regression tests (TODO2.md - 2 tasks remaining)
- **Agent 3**: 🔄 WORKING - E2E tests (TODO3.md - 2 tasks remaining)  
- **Agent 4**: ✅ DONE - CI Pipeline (`.agent_done_4` exists)

### E2E Test Progress

The `tempest-app/tests/e2e/app_harness_test.rs` received +572 lines of new code, expanding the E2E test infrastructure. This is part of Agent 3's work on TODO3.md.

### Summary

This hour focused on design debt identification through systematic design reviews. Seven new debt items were logged, primarily related to the deprecated Sandbox API and inconsistent spacing values. Two new skills/prompts were added to support ongoing and future design review work. Sprint 13 continues with Agents 2 and 3 still working on visual regression and E2E tests respectively.
