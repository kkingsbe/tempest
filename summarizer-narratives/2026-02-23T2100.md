## Narrative

This hour saw continued architect session work and significant progress toward Sprint 13 completion, with Agent 2 now finished.

### Sprint 13 Status

Sprint 13 is now 75% complete (3 of 4 agents done):

| Agent | Focus Area | Status | Tasks Remaining |
|-------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Golden-value tests | ✅ DONE | 0 |
| 2 | Visual regression tests | ✅ DONE | 0 |
| 3 | E2E tests | 🔄 WORKING | 3 |
| 4 | CI Pipeline | ✅ DONE | 0 |

**Agent 2 Completion**: Visual regression tests have been completed and `.agent_done_2` was created. Agent 2 successfully:
- Set up visual regression test framework with wgpu software backend
- Added visual tests for key radar rendering scenarios (REF, VEL, SW moments)
- Created baseline/golden images for regression testing

### Architect Session Updates

The architect continued working on Sprint 13 oversight and completed:
- Skills Inventory mapping (7 skills)
- Inbox check (comms/inbox/ empty)
- Gap Analysis (PRD inconsistencies, missing benchmarks)
- Design Debt Review (7 items identified: DD-001 to DD-007)
- Sprint Management (3/4 agents complete)
- Blocker Review (no active blockers)

**Key Findings**:
- Sprint Gate CLOSED until Agent 3 completes
- Design Debt: 7 HIGH priority items, recommend DD-005/DD-007/DD-002 for next sprint
- PRD Inconsistency: Visual regression threshold (1.5% vs 3%)

### Agent 3 Progress (E2E Tests)

Agent 3 continues working on E2E test infrastructure. Current uncommitted changes show +559 lines added to `app_harness_test.rs`, indicating active development on:
- E2E test harness with mock S3
- Station discovery and data loading tests

Remaining tasks for Agent 3:
1. Set up E2E test harness with mock S3
2. Add E2E tests for station discovery and data loading
3. Run full build/test suite, fix errors, create .agent_done_3

### Summary

Sprint 13 is nearing completion with Agent 2 finishing visual regression tests. Agent 3 continues working on E2E tests. Once Agent 3 completes and creates `.sprint_complete`, the sprint will be done and Sprint 14 can begin with design debt items (DD-005, DD-007, DD-002) as recommended.
