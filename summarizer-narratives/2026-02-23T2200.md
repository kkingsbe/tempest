# Sprint 13 Complete and Sprint 14 Begins

The hour spanning from 9 PM to 10 PM UTC on February 23rd, 2026 marked a significant transition point for the project, as one sprint concluded and another began.

## Sprint 13 Wraps Up

The previous sprint, Sprint 13, achieved full completion during this period. The commit log shows the final stages of this sprint coming together: work began with partial sessions where two of the four agents were completed, continued through additional partial sessions, and culminated in a design review session that wrapped up successfully. The architect formally closed Sprint 13 with commit b764105, acknowledging that all four agents had been completed as planned.

## Sprint 14 Takes Shape

Immediately following Sprint 13's completion, Sprint 14 was initiated with a clear focus on addressing design debt. This represents a natural evolution in the project's workflow, shifting from feature development to refactoring and improvement work that had been deferred. The design debt items that emerged during earlier sprints are now receiving dedicated attention, with the goal of improving the overall codebase quality and reducing technical friction.

## Documentation and Skill Development

Several important documentation updates occurred during this hour. The design review prompts were significantly expanded with 404 new lines of content, providing more comprehensive guidance for future review sessions. Perhaps most notably, a new skill document for iced-rs was added, comprising 1,372 lines of detailed information. This addition to the skills directory demonstrates continued investment in building out the project's knowledge base and ensuring that developers have access to high-quality reference materials.

## Testing Infrastructure Grows

The end-to-end test harness received substantial enhancements with the addition of 572 lines of new test code. This expansion indicates a continued commitment to robust testing practices, ensuring that the application behaves correctly across different scenarios. Additionally, a visual regression golden image was added to the test suite, specifically a reflectivity test image at 50 percent opacity. This new asset, totaling approximately 837 kilobytes, will help maintain visual consistency as the rendering system evolves.

## State and Debt Tracking Updates

The project tracking documents were updated to reflect the current state of affairs. Both ARCHITECT_STATE.md and DESIGN_DEBT.md saw modifications during this period, indicating that the team is actively maintaining these critical reference documents. The various TODO files also received updates, keeping the task list current.

## Summary

This hour represented a natural inflection point in the project's development cycle. The successful completion of Sprint 13, with all four agents finished, demonstrates the team's ability to execute planned work. The immediate transition to Sprint 14 with its design debt focus shows thoughtful project management, addressing technical improvements before they become larger problems. Combined with the expanded documentation, testing infrastructure, and visual regression capabilities, the project continues to mature and build toward its goals.
