# Sprint 14 Progress - Design Debt Reduction Underway

The hour from 10 PM to 11 PM UTC on February 23rd, 2026 saw continued progress on Sprint 14, with the architect agent running partial sessions and making significant strides in addressing design debt.

## Sprint 14 Status Update

Sprint 14 is now in full swing, focused specifically on addressing design debt items that have accumulated over previous sprints. The architect state shows:

- **Agent 1:** DONE - Completed DD-005 (ColorLegend padding fix) and DD-003 (StationSelector raw RGB colors). QA passed.
- **Agent 2:** WORKING - Still processing TODO items
- **Agent 3:** WORKING - Still processing TODO items  
- **Agent 4:** WORKING - Still processing TODO items

## Design Debt Progress

The DESIGN_DEBT.md file shows significant updates during this period, with 77 new lines added. The total open design debt items now stand at 14. Key progress includes:

- **DD-003:** Fixed - StationSelector raw RGB colors were replaced with a semantic color module (colors::TEXT_SECONDARY, colors::TEXT_PRIMARY, colors::ACCENT)
- **DD-005:** Fixed - ColorLegend padding corrected from .padding(10) to .padding(12) to align with the 8-point spacing scale

## Code Quality Improvements

Several components received quality improvements during this hour:

1. **elevation_tilt_selector.rs:** Fixed deprecated API usage - replaced `Text::Primary/Secondary` with `Text::Color` to comply with iced-rs best practices
2. **moment_switcher.rs:** Modified with 33 lines of changes
3. **station_selector.rs:** Updated with 14 lines of changes
4. **offline_indicator.rs:** Modified with 15 lines of changes

## Testing and Build Status

The test suite continues to perform well:
- **330+ tests pass** across all crates
- Build completes successfully with minimal warnings
- The e2e test harness in tempest-app received substantial enhancements with 559 new lines of test code

## Documentation Updates

Key documentation updates during this period:
- **ARCHITECT_STATE.md:** Updated to reflect current Sprint 14 progress (91 lines changed)
- **DESIGN_DEBT.md:** Expanded with 77 new lines documenting design debt items
- **LEARNINGS.md:** Added new entry documenting Agent 1's accomplishments in Sprint 14

## Summary

This hour represented steady progress on Sprint 14's design debt reduction goals. Agent 1 successfully completed its assigned debt items and passed QA, while Agents 2, 3, and 4 continue working on their respective tasks. The architect is running in partial session mode, indicating continued active work on the sprint objectives. With 14 design debt items total and progress being made on multiple fronts, the project continues its methodical approach to improving code quality while maintaining feature development momentum.
