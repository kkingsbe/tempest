## Narrative Body

This hour marked a significant period of consolidation and completion across multiple workstreams. The architect agent sessions that had been running incrementally over the previous hours reached their conclusions, with four commits (bf3dfd8, ce6d29f, c9bf615, 832c302, e05efc7) representing completed architect and design review sessions. This represents a maturation of the project's architectural foundation as these specialized agents wrapped up their analysis and implementation work.

The most substantial change during this period was the major refactoring of DESIGN_DEBT.md, which saw a net reduction of 210 lines. This cleanup effort represents a deliberate push to address technical debt that had accumulated over previous development cycles. The design debt archive received modest additions (+12 lines), suggesting that reviewed and addressed items were properly documented before removal from the active debt tracker. Additionally, LEARNINGS.md gained 18 lines of new insights, indicating that lessons captured during this work period are being preserved for future reference.

The codebase saw targeted refinements to several tempest-app components. The elevation_tilt_selector.rs (-25 lines), moment_switcher.rs (-33 lines), offline_indicator.rs (-15 lines), and station_selector.rs (-14 lines) all underwent simplification and cleanup. These reductions suggest these UI components were streamlined, potentially removing dead code, consolidating logic, or improving the overall structure of these modules.

Perhaps the most notable technical investment during this period was the substantial expansion of e2e testing. The app_harness_test.rs file gained 559 lines, representing a major investment in end-to-end test coverage. This expansion indicates a commitment to improving test reliability and confidence in the application's behavior, particularly for the application's core user-facing functionality.

The cleanup extended to administrative files as well, with the deletion of .agent_done_1 (41 lines), .agent_done_4 (38 lines), and ARCHITECT_STATE.md (43 lines). These deletions represent the completion of agent work cycles and the archiving of state files that are no longer needed, helping to keep the project directory clean and focused.

Overall, this period represented a productive hour of finishing work: completing architect sessions, reducing design debt, expanding test coverage, and cleaning up transient files. The net positive of 536 lines across 25 files (+919/-383) reflects meaningful progress in code quality and test coverage, balanced with responsible reduction of complexity and debt.
