## Narrative Body

This hour represented a significant period of active refactoring and design debt reduction. While no new commits were recorded during this hour, substantial work was performed in the working directory, advancing critical infrastructure improvements to the tempest-app.

The most substantial change during this period was the in-progress migration from the deprecated `Sandbox` API to the modern function-based API for the iced framework. The main.rs file saw 492 lines of modifications, including the renaming of the core `App` struct to `State` and the adoption of `iced::{Element, Task, Theme}` instead of the deprecated `Sandbox` trait. This addresses DD-001 (Deprecated Sandbox API) from the design debt tracker and represents a foundational architectural improvement.

Complementing this refactoring, two new semantic modules were introduced to address design debt items:

1. **[`tempest-app/src/spacing.rs`](tempest-app/src/spacing.rs)** - A comprehensive 8-point spacing scale module defining constants (XXS=2, XS=4, SM=8, MD=12, BASE=16, LG=24, XL=32, XXL=48, XXXL=64). This addresses DD-002 (Arbitrary Spacing Values) by providing a consistent spacing system throughout the application.

2. **[`tempest-app/src/colors.rs`](tempest-app/src/colors.rs)** - Semantic color constants organized into modules (surface, text, accent, border). This addresses DD-004 (Raw RGB Color Values in ColorLegend) by centralizing color definitions with meaningful names like `surface::BG_PRIMARY`, `text::PRIMARY`, and `accent::HOVER`.

The DESIGN_DEBT.md file saw substantial cleanup with 70 lines changed (net reduction), as design debt items were addressed and removed from the active tracking list. The DESIGN_DEBT_ARCHIVE.md received +11 lines of archived items, preserving the history of addressed debt. DESIGN_REVIEW_STATE.md was updated with 35 lines of changes, reflecting the current state of design review activities.

The LEARNINGS.md file gained 9 lines of new insights, continuing the practice of capturing lessons learned during development. The Cargo.lock file received significant updates (1271 lines changed), likely reflecting dependency version updates required by the iced framework migration.

Additional minor refinements were made to tempest-app components: color_legend.rs (-9 lines), timeline.rs (-12 lines), and TODO3.md (-6 lines). The tempest-app/Cargo.toml was updated with a minor version change.

Overall, this hour represented focused infrastructure work: migrating to modern iced APIs, establishing consistent design tokens (spacing and colors), and continuing the systematic reduction of design debt. The net change of +501 lines across 10 files (+1209/-708) reflects significant new infrastructure being put in place to support future development.
