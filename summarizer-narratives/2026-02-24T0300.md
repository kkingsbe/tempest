## Narrative

This period focused on a design review session. A single commit was made that completed the design review workflow for Run #7.

### Changes Made

**Design Review Session #7:**
- Reviewed two UI components: `ColorLegend` and `ElevationTiltSelector`
- Added two new design debt items to the tracking:
  - DD-015
  - DD-016

### Files Modified
- `DESIGN_DEBT.md` - 108 lines changed (simplified/reorganized design debt tracking)
- `DESIGN_REVIEW_STATE.md` - 36 lines changed (updated review session state)

The changes represent maintenance work on the design review process itself, with cleanup and reorganization of design debt documentation rather than feature development.
