## Design Review Activity

A design review session (#11) was completed, reviewing ColorLegend and CacheManager components. The session identified new 8-point spacing violations:

### New Design Debt Items Added:

1. **DD-018: Non-8-point spacing (zero values) in TimelineState**
   - Component: `tempest-app/src/timeline.rs`
   - Lines: 415, 475 (spacing(0), padding(0))
   - Status: OPEN

2. **DD-019: Non-8-point spacing (zero) in ColorLegend**
   - Component: `tempest-app/src/color_legend.rs`
   - Lines: 129 (spacing(0))
   - Status: OPEN

3. **DD-020: Non-8-point padding values in CacheManager**
   - Component: `tempest-app/src/cache_manager.rs`
   - Lines: 252, 257, 268, 298, 300, 342 (padding values 10, 5, 20)
   - Priority: High
   - Status: OPEN

### Resolved Items:
- **DD-012**: Non-8-point spacing in CacheManager - RESOLVED (Sprint 16)
- **DD-017**: Non-8-point spacing in StationSelector - RESOLVED (Sprint 16)

### Design Review State Update:
- Total runs completed: 11
- Total open design debt: 3 (increased from 2)
- CacheManager violations increased from 2 to 3 (new DD-020)
- TimelineState violations increased from 3 to 4 (new DD-018)
- ColorLegend violations increased from 2 to 3 (new DD-019)

The design review continues to iterate through UI components in tempest-app, systematically identifying and cataloging spacing violations against the 8-point grid system defined in the iced-rs skill.
