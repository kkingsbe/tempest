This one-hour session saw continued progress across multiple workstreams. The architect is actively working on Sprint 18, with commit activity indicating session progress and partial completion states. Four commits were made during this period, totaling approximately 1,809 additions and 197 deletions across 31 files.

Agent2 completed significant work during this session. The agent created the `.agent_done_2` marker file to signal completion of their assigned tasks, and all TODO2 tasks were marked as complete with verification completed. This represents a meaningful milestone in the current sprint's deliverables.

The session also saw important test infrastructure additions. New test files were introduced including `app_harness_test.rs` for end-to-end testing and `golden_images.rs` for visual regression testing. The visual regression testing golden images were updated, ensuring that the test suite reflects the current expected state of the application's visual output. These infrastructure improvements strengthen the project's testing coverage and provide better confidence in future changes.
