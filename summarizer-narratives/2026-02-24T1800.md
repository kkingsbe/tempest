## Active Blocker

**Pre-existing Build Failures (tempest-app)**
- 62 compilation errors related to iced 0.13.x API compatibility
- Resolution documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Blocks: Full build, E2E testing

## Looking Forward

Sprint 18 is nearing completion with CI infrastructure now in place. Main focus areas:
1. Complete remaining agent tasks (Agents 1, 2)
2. Resolve Agent 4 inconsistency
3. Address iced 0.13.x build blocker to enable full testing
4. Continue reducing design debt backlog
