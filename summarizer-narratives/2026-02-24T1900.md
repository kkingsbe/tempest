## What This Session Captured

This session was a continuation of the ongoing Architect session focused on systematic design debt reduction and knowledge capture. The primary activities during this hour included:

1. **Design Debt Reduction** - Significant progress was made in addressing accumulated design debt. The net reduction in DESIGN_DEBT.md shows substantial cleanup of technical debt items, with new debt being archived rather than added to the active tracking file.

2. **Learnings Documentation** - New content was added to LEARNINGS.md (+43 lines), capturing insights and decisions made during the architecture sessions. This ongoing documentation ensures knowledge is preserved for future reference.

3. **Progress Tracking** - Regular progress reports were maintained in the comms/outbox directory, documenting the architect's current status, findings, and next steps.

4. **State Management** - Updates to DESIGN_REVIEW_STATE.md reflect the evolving state of design reviews and architectural decisions being tracked.

## Looking Forward

The session ended with a partial commit indicating the work will continue. Key areas expected to be addressed in subsequent sessions include:

- Continued design debt reduction efforts
- Further refinement of architecture documentation
- Ongoing learnings capture from the architect's analysis
- Progress toward completing the current phase of architectural work

The commit message "session partial - will continue" indicates this was a natural checkpoint in the work rather than a completion point, suggesting sustained momentum in the architect's efforts.
