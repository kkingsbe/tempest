## Detailed Activity

### 1. Commits (2 commits)

1. **a3de77a1f** → **34f7247**: chore(design-review): session complete
2. **34f7247** → **d8c9c46**: chore(architect): session partial - Sprint 22 in progress, Sprint 23 prepared

### 2. Sprint 22 Status

- **Agent 1:** Completed Performance Benchmark Baseline task (.agent_done_1 exists)
- **Agent 2:** Previously completed - .agent_done_2 was removed
- **Agent 3:** Previously completed - .agent_done_3 was removed  
- **Agent 4:** Previously completed - .agent_done_4 was removed
- **Sprint Status:** IN PROGRESS (.sprint_complete NOT EXISTS)

The removal of .agent_done_2, .agent_done_3, and .agent_done_4 files suggests a reset or re-organization of sprint state, while only Agent 1's done marker remains.

### 3. Sprint 23 Preparation (Complete)

Sprint 23 has been prepared with 10 design debt items:

| TODO File | Items Scheduled | Components |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| TODO2.md | DD-041, DD-042, DD-056 | StationSelector |
| TODO3.md | DD-044, DD-045, DD-046 | Timeline |
| TODO4.md | DD-043, DD-051, DD-053 | ColorLegend, OfflineIndicator |

## Session Notes

- Sprint 22 is in progress with Agent 1 having completed their work
- Sprint 23 is fully prepared with 10 design debt items ready for assignment
- Build is healthy - both cargo build and cargo test pass
- Discord notification failed (network error), progress was written to comms/outbox instead
- The ARCHITECT_PARALLEL.md prompt was significantly updated (180+ lines)

---

## Next Steps

1. Sprint 22 completion - verify all agents have completed their tasks
2. Sprint 23 launch - assign design debt items to available agents
3. Begin addressing high-priority design debt items (DD-041, DD-042, DD-043, DD-044, DD-045)
