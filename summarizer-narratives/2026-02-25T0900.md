## Current Project Status

Based on the most recent architect progress update (2026-02-25T07:09), the project status is:

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Tasks |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Agent 1 | IN PROGRESS | E2E Test Harness, DD-049, DD-051 |
| Agent 2 | IN PROGRESS | Golden Reference CLI, DD-056, DD-042 |
| Agent 3 | ✅ DONE | All 4 tasks complete |
| Agent 4 | IN PROGRESS | BUILDFIX (test compilation errors) |

### Build Status
- **cargo build:** ✅ PASSES
- **cargo test:** ❌ FAILS (5 compile errors in test_utils.rs)

### Blocker
The main blocker is **test_utils.rs compilation errors**:
1. `PanDirection` defined multiple times (E0255)
2. `Message` reimported multiple times (E0252)
3. `Moment` reimported multiple times (E0252)
4. Cannot find `test_utils` module (E0433)
5. Type mismatch between `gui_harness::State` and crate `State` (E0308)

This is assigned to Agent 4 as the BUILDFIX task.

### Design Debt
- **Open items:** 15
- **High priority (next sprint):** 3 items

## Notes

This was a quiet period with no code commits. The team appears to be waiting on Agent 4 to resolve the BUILDFIX before making further progress. Agent 2 completed their sprint successfully (TODO2.md shows all tasks complete with 87/88 tests passing).
