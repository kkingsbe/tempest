## Notes

This was a brief but significant period marking the completion of Sprint 24. The architect wrapped up the session after confirming all agents had completed their work. Agent 4 verified the build was working (the _is_online method issue was already fixed by Agent 1 in the previous hour) and created the final sprint completion markers. The project is now in a clean state with all tests passing.
