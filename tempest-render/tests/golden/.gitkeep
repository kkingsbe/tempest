# Golden Reference Images Directory

This directory contains golden reference images for visual regression tests.

## Adding New Golden References

To add a new golden reference:

1. Run the test with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test --test visual_regression <test_name>`
2. This will generate the baseline image in this directory
3. Commit the new image to the repository

## Image Format

- Resolution: 1920x1080 (as per PRD)
- Format: PNG with RGBA channels
- Naming: `<test_name>.png` (e.g., `reflectivity_sweep.png`)

## CI Behavior

- CI runs tests without golden update mode
- If any test exceeds the 1.5% diff threshold, CI fails
- The diff image is saved as a CI artifact for inspection
